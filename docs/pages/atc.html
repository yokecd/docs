          Overview
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Air Traffic Controller (ATC) is a Kubernetes controller that enables the creation of CustomResourceDefinitions
          (CRDs) and implements them through Yoke flights.
        </p>
        <h3>
          The Problem with Current Deployment Tools
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Client-Side Package Managers:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Yoke introduces an innovative "packages as code" model, shareable as WASM executables. However, client-side package
          managers are limited in Kubernetes environments. These tools:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Operate outside Kubernetes APIs, deploying resources ad hoc into clusters.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fail to track package lifecycles effectively without reliance on resource labels or implementation specific
            secrets.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Such reliance on tool-specific implementations makes managing packages less transparent and harder to standardize.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Limitations of ArgoCD:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Tools like ArgoCD rely on generic container resources (e.g., Argo Applications), which offer flexibility but
          introduce challenges:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Permission escalation: Users creating Argo applications, either via `kubectl` or Git commits, can bypass
            organizational RBAC, effectively assuming Argo's deployment permissions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Underuse of Kubernetes API validation: Applications are generic and pass unchecked values to their underlying
            resource renderer. For example, if using helm, values are unchecked by the kubernetes api and we must rely on
            chart implementations to validate and surface errors later down the pipeline.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lack of specificity: Applications are deployed as generic resources, obscuring their types and requiring labels or
            naming conventions to organize and filter them.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          Goal of the Air Traffic Controller
        </h2>
        <p>
          The ATC makes package management native to Kubernetes by defining packages as specific, well-structured resources.
          This approach:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Utilizes Kubernetes features like OpenAPI validation for robust package definitions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enforces RBAC policies, limiting resource deployment and enhancing security.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By aligning with Kubernetes' native capabilities, ATC improves security, governance, and control over deployments.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="container">
        <h2>
          How It Works
        </h2>
        <p>
          The ATC consists of two components: the controller deployment and the Airway CustomResourceDefinition (CRD). An
          Airway is an API that enables you to define and connect two core elements: a new CRD specification of your creation
          and its corresponding flight implementation, which is specified as a URL to a WASM executable flight.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ATC monitors Airways and creates the specified CRD, and spawns Flight Controllers within its process to manage
          the corresponding CRs. When a CR is created, updated, or modified, the relevant Flight Controller invokes the
          corresponding WASM flight to compute the desired state of your resources and applies these changes to the cluster.
        </p>
        <p>
          This design allows you to define custom packages and enables your users to deploy them as native Kubernetes
          resources.

        <h2>
          How to install the ATC
        </h2>
        <pre><code class="language-bash"># Substitute the following variables as desired for your deployment.
NAMESPACE=atc
VERSION=v0.0.2
RELEASE=atc
URL=https://github.com/yokecd/yoke/releases/download/atc-installer%2F$VERSION/atc-installer.wasm.gz

# Use the yoke cli to deploy the Air Traffic Controller!
yoke takeoff -namespace $NAMESPACE $RELEASE $URL</code></pre>
        <h2>
          Getting started
        </h2>
        <p>
          We will be following along with the example found at
          <a href="https://github.com/yokecd/examples/tree/main/atc">
            https://github.com/yokecd/examples/tree/main/atc
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin we will need two things:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The definition of our custom resource
          </li>
          <li>
            A flight (executable wasm program) to implement our resource as a package
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For the sake of example let's assume that for our enterprise we wish to create a package representing a "Backend" or
          "API" service.
        </p>
        <p>
          First let's define a Go package containing our new Custom Resource type.
        </p>
        <pre><strong>source:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://github.com/yokecd/examples/tree/main/atc/backend/v1/backend.go">atc/backend/v1/backend.go</a></pre>
        <pre><code id="code_backend_v1" class="language-go">loading...</code></pre>
        <p>
          Next we will want to implement a program to transform this resource into an array of resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that nothing in our example implementation is specific to backends or any type of workload. For this example
          our package will output the backend as a kubernetes Deployment and Service.
        </p>
        <pre><strong>source:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://github.com/yokecd/examples/tree/main/atc/backend/v1/flight/main.go">atc/backend/v1/flight/main.go</a></pre>
        <pre><code id="code_backend_v1_flight" class="language-go">loading...</code></pre>
        <p>
          The flight executable can now be built via the Go Toolchain:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build ./path/to/main </code></pre>
        <p>
          Where and how you choose to host this binary such that it is fetchable by the ATC controller is up to you. Common
          choices include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In a public or private github release
          </li>
          <li>
            In an internal service you deploy in your cluster
          </li>
          <li>
            Any service that hosts assets for you and allows you to fetch them over http/https.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Since we are following the example from the
          <strong>
            yokecd/examples
          </strong>
          repository, we will be using the latest
          github release of this flight:
          <strong>
            https://github.com/yokecd/examples/releases/download/latest/atc_backend_v1_flight.wasm.gz
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now all that's left is to build an Airway using our
          <strong>
            v1.Backend
          </strong>
          type in conjunction with our Flight.
          Let's define it in code.
        </p>
        <pre><strong>source:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://github.com/yokecd/examples/tree/main/atc/backend/airway/main.go">atc/backend/airway/main.go</a></pre>
        <pre><code id="code_backend_airway" class="language-go">loading...</code></pre>
        <p>
          With this final piece we have built a flight that installs the Airway that will bind our Backend resource to its
          implementing flight. Fortunately for the rest of this example, it is also hosted in the github release of our
          examples repository.
        </p>
        <p>
          Putting it all together let's install yoke, setup a local cluster, install the atc, install our airway, and finally
          install our new backend component.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash"># install yoke cli
