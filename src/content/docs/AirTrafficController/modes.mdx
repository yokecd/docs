title: Modes
---
Airways are custom resources that allow you to create custom resource definitions bound to a flight implementation.
This enables us to manage our packages as Kubernetes resources. Airway modes refer to how the subresources of our packages
deployed by the ATC are managed.

Airways support three modes:

- standard
- static
- dynamic

An airway's mode can be set as part of that Airway's specification:

```yaml
apiVersion: yoke.cd/v1alpha1
kind: Airway
metadata:
  name: modes.examples.com
spec:
  mode: dynamic
  # ... other fields ...
```

Let's explore what each of these modes do.

## Standard

Standard mode is the default and is equivalent to leaving the `mode` property unset.

In Standard mode, subresources of your packages are left unmanaged.
This means third-party actors (users with API access, other controllers, and so on) can make changes to subresources created by the ATC.

These changes will persist until the package's custom resource is modified and the ATC computes a new desired state for the package --
at which point any conflicting changes made by other actors will be overwritten via server-side apply.

The only way to rectify drift in this mode without updating the package’s custom resource is to set the `fixDriftInterval` in the airway's specification.

This mode is useful when you want the flexibility to make manual changes to your cluster.

## Static

Static mode, as its name implies, aims to prevent drift from the desired state from happening at all.

If a subresource of a package is modified in a way that conflicts with the desired state, the update is rejected at admission, and you will see an error similar to the following:

_**admission webhook "resources.yoke.cd" denied the request: cannot modify flight sub-resources.**_

This mode is useful when you want to lock down changes to your cluster, keeping drift to a minimum.

In this mode, users must modify the custom resource representing the package to make changes, and are disallowed from modifying its subresources directly.

Although this mode is powerful and generally prevents drift, the admission webhook is configured to be ignored on failure.
This means that in rare, unexpected cases, drift can still occur. Therefore, it is still recommended to set the `fixDriftInterval` property.

## Dynamic

In Dynamic mode, changes to any subresources of packages managed by the ATC will requeue the package for evaluation.  
Unlike Static mode, where modifications are compared to the current desired state and rejected if they conflict,  
Dynamic mode always allows modifications to pass admission.

However, even if a conflicting state is admitted, the flight will be re-evaluated and the desired state reapplied.  
This mode is most similar to ArgoCD's self-healing behavior.
It's like using `fixDriftInterval`, except drift detection is triggered not on some interval duration, but on every change to a subresource.

Dynamic mode has one particularly interesting property: since the flight is being re-evaluated, it doesn't need to return the old desired state—it can compute a new one.  
This, coupled with [cluster-access](/docs/concepts/cluster-access/), means that flight implementations can react to changes made by users or controllers to their subresources.

Let's take a look at how this solves a classic Kubernetes problem: redeploying a Deployment when a Secret changes.

> **_Note:_**  
> We’ll be discussing this example at a high level. A fully working code example will be added to Yoke's [examples](https://github.com/yokecd/examples) repository in the future.

Suppose we have an Airway called `backends.examples.com`, and the flight associated with it produces three resources:

- A Deployment
- A Secret
- An ExternalSecret

An ExternalSecret is a custom resource from the [External Secrets Operator](https://external-secrets.io/latest/) project that allows you to sync secrets from external sources like Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, and more.

Our flight would have the following properties:

- Cluster-access is enabled at the Airway level.
- The Secret computes itself by reading its own data from the cluster.
- The ExternalSecret references the Secret.
- The Secret’s data is hashed and used as a label on the Deployment.

And that’s it. When a Secret changes in an external source, the following occurs:

1. The External Secrets Operator updates the Secret.
2. The package is requeued for evaluation because the Secret was modified.
3. The flight reads the Secret's data, hashes it, and updates the Deployment label.
4. The Deployment is redeployed.

The same effect would occur if we updated the Secret directly via `kubectl`, but this example offers a more realistic, real-world use case for how this might work.
