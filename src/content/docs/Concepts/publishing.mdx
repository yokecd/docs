## Overview

The Yoke CLI works by deploying releases backed by references to WASM executables.

Yoke supports three types of references:

- local paths
- http/https urls
- oci urls

Local paths are great for local development and quick interactions with your Kubernetes cluster.

However there comes a time when we want to publish our flights to a shareable location.

Common options include:

- Github Releases (https)
- Object Storage (https)
- In your own File-Server (http(s))
- Container Registries (oci)

## Private Flights

Yoke does not maintain any registry or have any plans to do so in the foreseeable future.
Instead it leans on existing container-registries to provide that functionality.

The **yoke stow** command allows us to publish our wasm files as open container images.

```bash
yoke stow ./main.wasm oci://ghcr.io/<org>/<repo>:<tag>
```

Yoke uses your docker credentials to authenticate to to the registry.

```bash
# Login to private registry
docker login ghcr.io

# Upload to private registry using oci:// prefixed url
yoke stow ./main.wasm oci://ghcr.io/example/repo:v1

# Use the url to fetch the wasm asset from the container registry.
yoke takeoff foo oci://ghcr.io/example/repo:v1
```
